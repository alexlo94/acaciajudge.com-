For the past year, I have been working with my team at <a href="http://www.unseenmedia.io/">Unseen Media</a> to design and build a tabletop mystery game that meaningfully incorporates augmented reality technology into gameplay.

For our first game, we designed a mail-to-home box that players open to reveal a bunch of "evidence" that gives clues to solve the mystery of what exactly killed social media influencer Charlotte Depsi in a coffee shop in Manhattan. Combining the physical evidence in front of them with web-based AR tools they can access through an online agent profile, players slowly unravel the story as they play.

This project evolved out of an idea from mid 2017, where we considered building a platform to incorporate AR technology into escape room games. Through over 100 interviews with potential customers, we eventually landed on the idea of a mail-to-home experience that does not limit players by location-based experiences or by time. The mail-to-home concept allowed access to a larger player market.

To date, we have participated in <i><a href="https://entrepreneur.nyu.edu/resource/prototyping-fund/">NYU’s Fall 2017 Prototyping Fund</a></i>, <i><a href="https://nycmedialab.org/">NYC Media Lab’s</a></i> inaugural XR Startup Bootcamp, the XR Beta Residency Program at the <i><a href="https://www.rlab.nyc/" text-decoration="underline">RLab</a></i> in Brooklyn Navy Yard, and presented our prototype at the <i><a href="https://www.awexr.com/">Augmented Reality Expo 2019</a></i> in Santa Clara. As a culmination of everything we accomplished during the XR Bootcamp, teammate Brian Hui pitched our product to an audience of over 300 at the Exploring Future Reality conference at NYU Kimmel Center. Video of our pitch can be viewed below.

Throughout this project, I have worked mainly with producing all 3D AR elements, but also contributed heavily to the overall game design, user experience design for AR, and digital fabrication of game objects. This project has given me the opportunity to hone my emerging media design skills, but also gave me extensive knowledge about the ins and outs of running an established business and marketing a consumer product.
