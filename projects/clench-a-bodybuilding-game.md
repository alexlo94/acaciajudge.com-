## {{title}}

I collaborated with Gabriella Cammarata and Alex Lotsos in order to create this two-player bodybuilding game. The object of the game was to strike the random pose displayed on screen by holding two pressure-sensitive controllers and standing on the mats provided. The game had an added social aspect to it, where the players were displayed on a large screen behind them via webcam feeds. The player who held the pose while applying the most pressure to the controllers was declared winner, and had their pose captured and displayed on the screen. This project was made using Unity for the digital game and Arduino for the custom controllers. My personal contribution to Clench was building the floorboard controller rig and creating all digital assets.
