My team and I made a prototype for a wearable device for those with impaired color vision that could detect color and tell the user what color he/she were seeing. For example, if a person wearing the prototype looked a red object, the screen would say “red.” Despite the wearable’s large and clunky size, our final prototype functioned properly and could detect colors correctly. We calculated that with a mass production scale using modern components, we could offer the product to consumers for around $70/ea.

For this project, I spearheaded the hardware build, user testing, research, and presentation design.
