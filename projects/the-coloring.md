## {{title}}

Created for a Human Computer Interaction class at NYU, I created this prototype in collaboration with Alex Lotsos and Camille Weins. The goal of this project was to create a wearable device, aimed at those with impaired color vision, that could detect color and display that color in a text-based output for interpretation by the user. While a bit large and ugly, our final prototype functioned properly and was able to detect colors correctly. We calculated that with a mass production scale using modern components, we could offer the product to consumers for around $70/ea.

For this project, I dealt with the hardware build, user testing, research, and presentation design.
