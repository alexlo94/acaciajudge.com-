## {{title}}

I designed this UI for a portion of an Unseen Media game. A player stumbles upon a “scrambled” photograph, and must locate a code inside of the board game box to unlock and “unscramble” the image to reach the next level. 

This design is now a current working prototype for Unseen Media’s game. So far, we received positive feedback from players and the design appears to be straightforward for users.
