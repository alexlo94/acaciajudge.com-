## {{title}}

I designed this UI for a portion of an Unseen Media game, where players are tasked with finding a code to unlock an image unscrambler that can "unscramble" images within the game box. We ended up building this design, and it is in the current working game prototype. So far, user testing has been positive and the design appears to be straightforward for users.
