Vessel was a live interactive motion capture performance piece I created with Spencer Cappiello, Manning Qu, Yuhan Zhang, Elizabeth White, and Elizabeth Casta√±o while in graduate school at NYU. For this project, we had a dancer (Elizabeth White) inside a glass room equipped with motion capture cameras, and placed an audience outside of that room, looking in. We asked the audience to send messages into our system through their cell phones, where our dancer would dance in reaction to the words appearing and surrounding her digital body, resulting in a highly interactive and visually stunning live performance piece. Screens surrounded the dancer within the room, and additional screens were set up within the audience area to bring them closer to the digital world as well. Unreal Engine, iKinema, OptiTrack, node.js, MotionBuilder, Maya 2018, After Effects, web were all utilized in order to create and present this project.

Re-presented in Fall 2018 at the opening of the RLab mixed reality development facility at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
