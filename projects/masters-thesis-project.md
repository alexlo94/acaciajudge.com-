### Eye Appearance and the Uncanny Valley

My Master's Thesis was a research project surrounding the concept of The Uncanny Valley, and featured a series of animations designed to investigate the role of eye movement in perceived "uncanniness" of a figure.

Animations were created by me from stock footage and this 3D model, using a combination of Maya 2018 and Adobe After Effects.

In the end, I was able to show that eye appearance alone was able to trigger the uncanny valley effect in humans.
