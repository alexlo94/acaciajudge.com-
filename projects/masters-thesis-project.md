### Eye Appearance and the Uncanny Valley

I submitted this project for my Master's Thesis. I compiled research around the concept of The Uncanny Valley, and the role of eye movement in perceived "uncanniness" of a figure. I then featured an original series of animations to investigate the uncanny valley.

I enhanced stock footage with a 3D model with a combination of Maya 2018 and Adobe After Effects. In the end, I was able to demonstrate that eye appearance alone triggered the uncanny valley effect in humans.

Alex Lotsos built the image rating app I used to gather data for this project.
