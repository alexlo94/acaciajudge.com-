## {{title}}

I created the following set of animations as a placeholder character rig in order to user test a Unity game. This was my first experiment animating via the puppet tool in After Effects.

<div class="frame"><img src="/static/images/uploads/idle.gif" class="object-fit:scale-down"></img></div>
<div class="frame"><img src="/static/images/uploads/jumping.gif" class="object-fit:scale-down"></img></div>
<div class="frame"><img src="/static/images/uploads/running.gif" class="object-fit:scale-down"></img></div>
