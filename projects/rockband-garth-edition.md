## {{title}}

I created this physical game in a collaboration with Alex Lotsos. It was a Rockband-like rhythm game paired with a physical controller, which was a Garth-from-Wayne's-World wig rigged with an accelerometer. The player wears the wig, and bangs his/her head along to the beat of Bohemian Rhapsody, triggering a button press within the game on each downward motion, and thus racking up  score in the game. For this project, I built the full Unity portion of the game, and sewed the accelerometer controls into the wig.
