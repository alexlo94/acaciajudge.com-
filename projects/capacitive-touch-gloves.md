## {{title}}

I, in collaboration with Alex Lotsos, created this physical game, using an Arduino Gemma, NeoPixels, conductive thread, and conductive fabric.

Imagine a digitally-enhanced game of tag: the goal of this game is for one player to hit the other playersâ€™ glove panel to deplete their "lives" one-by-one, until a final player was left standing. 
I created the touch sensitive gloves, while Alex programmed the algorithm for the game.

Additional glove model: Ali Fung.
