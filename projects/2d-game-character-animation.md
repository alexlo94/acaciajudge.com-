## {{title}}

I created the following set of animations as a placeholder character rig in order to user test a Unity game. It was my first experiment animating via the puppet tool in After Effects.

<div class="object-fit:scale-down"><img src="/static/images/uploads/idle.gif"></img></div>
<div class="object-fit:scale-down"><img src="/static/images/uploads/jumping.gif"></img></div>
<div class="object-fit:scale-down"><img src="/static/images/uploads/running.gif"></img></div>
