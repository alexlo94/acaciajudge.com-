## {{title}}

Created using various stock images found online in order to quickly communicate an AR product concept to teammates at Unseen Media.

In this design, I recommended a very simple UI with on-screen instructions that prompted the user to scan their surroundings for clues. When the correct image was scanned, mysterious green dust would appear around an area of interest in the photo.

<div class="switcher">
<div class="wrapper">
<div class="frame">
<img src="/static/images/uploads/tabletopar_phone_interface.png" class="object-fit:contain"></img>
</div>
<div class="frame">
<img src="/static/images/uploads/tabletopar3.png" class="object-fit:scale-down"></img>
