## {{title}}

I created this augmented reality experience in collaboration with Naomi Losman. Our goal was to build an AR app that would make scenes of a Harry Potter book come alive and leap off the page. We animated two pivotal moments: the sorting hat song from the beginning of the book, and the flying keys near the end of the book. I animated the flying key sequence, while my project partner Naomi animated the Sorting Hat sequence.

Using <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity Game Engine</a> and <a href="https://developer.vuforia.com/">Vuforia</a>, I augmented the appropriate pages of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone so that my computer’s webcam could recognize the pages, and project the immersive experience on the book’s pages.
