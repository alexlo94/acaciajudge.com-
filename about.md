My name is Acacia (Casey) Judge, and I am a designer focusing on work in animation, visual effects, and game design. I am passionate about designing for the best possible user experience and take it into consideration in every project I do.

Currently, I am working with my company <u><a href="http://www.unseenmedia.io/">Unseen Media</a></u> in order to design and produce games that integrate augmented reality technology.
